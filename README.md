V1:
# Maze_like_a_wave_Wave_Function_Collapse
A simple maze/pixel diffusion generator in python using the graphics library(by John Zelle).

It strat by generating the optimal path between the start and the gool and then it mutate it a number of time.
you can easly cange parameters like LabSize, NumMutations, TimePerMutation, or the mutations in Rules.py

the little squares white and red represent respectively if a walkable square is been already mutated in all the possible way or not.
the fact that in the video there are white squares in not walkable spots is a bug thet es been olready resolved.
V2:
Now is an auto generated catch the chicken game, playable in a few clicks with the executable.
